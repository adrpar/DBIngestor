DBIngestor library
------------------

This library provides wrappers to data ingestion into various DB systems,
such as MySQL, SQLite3, and ODBC compatible systems. You can use
this C++ library to ingest data in any format (you need to implement
the reading routines though). The library provides an ingestion buffer
that allows for multiple rows to be ingested at one time. This greatly
improves ingestion performance. Further assertion and conversion functions
are provided for elementary data transformation and processing. These can
easily be extended by custom functions and many examples for implementing
such functions are provided in the source.

An instructive example on how to write ingestors using the DBIngestor
library is found in the example directory. Also have a look at the
AsciiIngest project found at:

Implementation Limitations:
---------------------------

Currently resume ingest is only supported for MySQL and ODBC (but not BulkODBC)
DB abastractors... If you need support for BulkODBC or Sqlite3, just drop me a
